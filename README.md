# Run Scripts Extension for Modal File Manager

This extension for [Modal File Manager](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager) gives the user the ability to create and run scripts. All scripts are kept in the `~/.config/modalfilemanager/scripts/` directory. Upon loading the extension for the first time, this directory is created and some example scripts are copied to it.

To run this extension, you have to have Modal File Manager version 0.1.4 or greater. This is due to additions to the extension API needed for this extension to work.

Before a script is ran, some environment variables are created in the run environment. These are in addition to the environment variables setup in the preferences. These are:

| Environment Variable | Description |
| ---- | -------- |
| CURRENT_DIRECTORY | The current directory for the cursor |
| CURRENT_FILE | The current file name for the cursor |
| LEFT_PANE | The directory of the left file pane |
| LEFT_PANE_SELECTED_FILE | The last highlighted file in the left file pane |
| RIGHT_PANE | The directory of the right file pane |
| RIGHT_PANE_SELECTED_FILE | The last highlighted file in the right file pane |
| FILES_SELECTED | A newline separated list of selected files |
